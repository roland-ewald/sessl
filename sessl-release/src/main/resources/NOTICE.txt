Open source, licensed under Apache 2.0 (see LICENSE.txt).

This software is based on several open-source projects:

- Scala 2.10.1 (http://scala-lang.org), a programming language

- JAMES II 0.9.1 (http://jamesii.org), a modeling and simulation framework available under a custom open-source license (see libs/licenses/james2). JAMES II is based on several other open source libraries that are included here as well (e.g. Hibernate, Apache Commons, etc.).

- The core of SBMLsimulator version 1.0 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/simulation-core, http://www.ra.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/SBMLsimulator), an SBML simulator written in Java and licensed under LGPLv3 (unnecessary code has been stripped from the JAR)

- Opt4J 3.0 (http://opt4j.sourceforge.net) open source Java-based framework for evolutionary computation

- OMNeT++ (http://www.omnetpp.org) network simulation library and framework (not included), a win64 executable sample model from the OMNeT++ distribution is included; to be used for testing

The transitive dependencies of the above tools (except OMNeT++) are also distributed, please find the version and license information in the corresponding JAR files (see /libs folder).
