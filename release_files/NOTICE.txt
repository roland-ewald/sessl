SESSL - Simulation Experiment Specification via a Scala Layer
Copyright 2012 Roland Ewald

The software is based on several open-source projects:

- Scala 2.9.2 (http://scala-lang.org)

- JAMES II 0.8.7 (http://jamesii.org), a modeling and simulation framework available under a custom open-source license (see libs/licenses/james2). JAMES II is based on several other open source libraries that are included here as well (e.g. Hibernate, Apache Commons, etc.).

- The core of SBMLsimulator version 1.0 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/simulation-core, http://www.ra.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/SBMLsimulator), an SBML simulator written in Java and licensed under LGPLv3 (unnecessary code has been stripped from the JAR)
